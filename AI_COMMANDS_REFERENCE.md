## 💡 Pro Tips

### ✅ Works:

- `add john` (casual)
- `john's balance` (possessive)
- `who is alice` (question)
- `delete bob` (direct)

### ❌ Unnecessary:

- "I would like to add john" (too formal)
- "Show the balance of customer john" (too wordy)
- "Please tell me about alice" (no need for "please")

### 🎯 Best Practices:

1. **Be concise:** "add john" not "I want to add customer john"
2. **Use names:** "john's balance" not "customer balance for john"
3. **Ask naturally:** "who is alice" not "show customer alice"
4. **Skip extras:** "delete bob" not "please delete customer bob"

## 🧠 Context Memory

The AI remembers your last 10 messages:

```
You: "create john doe"
AI: "Customer created!"
You: "what's his balance"     ← AI knows "his" = John Doe
AI: "John Doe's balance is ₦0"
```
